  abstract = {This paper provides a two-step approach based on the stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) to improve short-term prediction. In the first step of this framework, a Hull-
White (HW) model is applied to obtain a baseline prediction model from previous days.
Then, the extended Vasicek model (EV) is employed for modeling the difference between
observations and baseline predictions (residuals) during an individual day. The parameters
of this time-varying model are estimated at each sample using the residuals in a short
duration of time before the time point of prediction; so it provides a real time prediction.
The extracted model recovers the valuable local variation information during each day. The
performance of our method in comparison with other methods improves significantly in
terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative
error (MRE) for real data from Tehran’s highways and the open-access PeMS database.
We also demonstrate that the proposed model is appropriate for imputing the missing data
in traffic dataset and it is more efficient than the probabilistic principal component analysis
(PPCA) and k-Nearest neighbors (k-NN) methods.},

  abstract = {The missing data problem remains as a difficulty in a diverse variety of transportation
applications, e.g. traffic flow prediction and traffic pattern recognition. To solve this problem,
numerous algorithms had been proposed in the last decade to impute the missed data.
However, few existing studies had fully used the traffic flow information of neighboring
detecting points to improve imputing performance. In this paper, probabilistic principle
component analysis (PPCA) based imputing method, which had been proven to be one of
the most effective imputing methods without using temporal or spatial dependence, is
extended to utilize the information of multiple points. We systematically examine the
potential benefits of multi-point data fusion and study the possible influence of measurement
time lags. Tests indicate that the hidden temporal–spatial dependence is nonlinear
and could be better retrieved by kernel probabilistic principle component analysis (KPPCA)
based method rather than PPCA method. Comparison proves that imputing errors can be
notably reduced, if temporal–spatial dependence has been appropriately considered.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a prediction model is developed that combines a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a Kalman filter for online forecasting of traffic safety on expressways. Raw time-to-collision (TTC) samples are divided into two categories: those representing vehicles in risky situations and those in safe situations. Then, the GMM is used to model the bimodal distribution of the TTC samples, and the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation parameters of the TTC distribution are obtained using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We propose a new traffic safety indicator, named the proportion of exposure to traffic conflicts (PETTC), for assessing the risk and predicting the safety of expressway traffic. A Kalman filter is applied to forecast the short-term safety indicator, PETTC, and solves the online safety prediction problem. A dataset collected from four different expressway locations is used for performance estimation. The test results demonstrate the precision and robustness of the prediction model under different traffic conditions and using different datasets. These results could help decision-makers to improve their online traffic safety forecasting and enable the optimal operation of expressway traffic management systems.},
